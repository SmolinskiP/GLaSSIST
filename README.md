## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Windows Installer (Easy)
1. **Download** [GLaSSIST-Setup.exe](https://github.com/SmolinskiP/GLaSSIST/releases/latest/download/GLaSSIST-Setup.exe) from releases
2. **Run installer** and follow setup wizard
3. **Enter your HA details** during installation
4. **Launch** and start talking to your smart home

No Python knowledge required. Everything is bundled and configured automatically.

### Option 2: Linux (Beta)
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmolinskiP/GLaSSIST/main/install-linux.sh && chmod +x install-linux.sh && ./install-linux.sh
```

### Option 3: From Source (For developers)

### 1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmolinskiP/GLaSSIST.git
cd GLaSSIST
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For modern settings UI (Flet-based)
pip install flet>=0.21.0
```

### 3. Configuration
Create `.env` file:
```env
# === CONNECTION ===
HA_HOST=your-homeassistant.local:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here

# === WAKE WORD ===
HA_WAKE_WORD_ENABLED=true
HA_WAKE_WORD_MODELS=alexa,hey_jarvis
HA_WAKE_WORD_THRESHOLD=0.5

# === ACTIVATION ===
HA_HOTKEY=ctrl+shift+h

# === AUDIO ===
HA_VAD_MODE=3
HA_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_SEC=0.8
HA_SOUND_FEEDBACK=true

# === VISUAL ===
HA_RESPONSE_TEXT_ENABLED=true

# === OPTIONAL ===
HA_PIPELINE_ID=your_pipeline_id
DEBUG=false
```

**Pro tip:** Use the modern "Settings" interface in the app instead of manually creating the file. Features beautiful Flet-based UI with real-time validation and auto-complete. This isn't 1995, we have proper GUIs now.

### 4. Run
```bash
python main.py
```

**Pro tip:** Use the installer unless you want to modify the code. It's way fucking easier.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Home Assistant Configuration

### Access Token
1. Go to `Profile` ‚Üí `Long-Lived Access Tokens`
2. Click `Create Token`
3. Copy token to `.env`

Without this, the app will be as useful as a calculator without batteries.

### Pipelines (optional)
The app automatically fetches available pipelines. If you have more than one, select it in settings.

## üîÑ Interactive Prompts Integration

GLaSSIST v2.0 introduces **Interactive Prompts** - allowing Home Assistant to ask questions and receive voice responses. Perfect for confirmations, choices, and interactive automations.

### HTTP API Server

GLaSSIST runs an HTTP server (default port `8766`) that accepts prompt requests:

**Endpoint**: `POST http://YOUR_GLASSIST_IP:8766/prompt`

**Request format**:
```json
{
  "message": "Question to ask the user",
  "context": "Context for the assistant to understand the situation",
  "timeout": 15
}
```

**Response**: `{"status": "accepted", "message": "Prompt will be processed"}`

### Home Assistant Integration

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  glassist_prompt:
    url: "http://YOUR_GLASSIST_IP:8766/prompt"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: |
      {
        "message": "{{ message }}",
        "context": "{{ context }}",
        "timeout": {{ timeout | default(15) }}
      }

automation:
  - alias: "Ask before turning on lights"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: light.living_room_light
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: rest_command.glassist_prompt
        data:
          message: "Turn on the living room lights?"
          context: "User wants to control living room lighting"
          timeout: 15
```

### Manual Testing

Test the API directly with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:8766/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Turn on the lights in the living room?",
    "context": "You ask user if they want to turn on lights in living room",
    "timeout": 15
  }'
```

Or via Home Assistant Developer Tools:
- **Service**: `rest_command.glassist_prompt`
- **Service Data**:
```yaml
message: "Turn on the lights in the living room?"
context: "You ask user if they want to turn on lights in living room" 
timeout: 15
```

### How It Works

1. **HA sends prompt** ‚Üí GLaSSIST receives HTTP request
2. **GLaSSIST asks user** ‚Üí Plays TTS question and shows animation
3. **User responds via voice** ‚Üí Wake word activation or hotkey
4. **GLaSSIST processes response** ‚Üí Uses context to understand what user is responding to
5. **Action executed** ‚Üí Based on user's voice response (yes/no/specific action)

### Use Cases

- **Confirmation dialogs**: "Turn on bedroom lights?" ‚Üí User: "Yes"
- **Security prompts**: "Someone at the door. Turn on porch light?" ‚Üí User: "Yes please"  
- **Energy management**: "High electricity usage detected. Turn off unnecessary devices?" ‚Üí User: "Turn off the TV"
- **Schedule conflicts**: "Meeting in 10 minutes. Should I dim the lights?" ‚Üí User: "Yes, set to 30%"

For detailed configuration with advanced examples, automations, and use cases, see:  
**[üìã INTERACTIVE_PROMPTS_SETUP.md](INTERACTIVE_PROMPTS_SETUP.md)**

### Security Notes

- **Local network only** - The API server binds to all interfaces for LAN access
- **No authentication** - Intended for trusted local network use only  
- **Firewall considerations** - Port 8766 needs to be accessible from HA server

## ü§ñ Wake Word Models
GLaSSIST includes over **100 pre-trained wake word models** converted to ONNX format for Windows compatibility. Models are sourced from the [Home Assistant Wakewords Collection](https://github.com/fwartner/home-assistant-wakewords-collection/tree/main) and optimized for desktop use.

Available wake words include:
- **Standard**: `Alexa`, `Hey Jarvis`, `Hey Mycroft`
- **Creative**: `Computer`, `Scarlett`, `Glados`, `Mr. Anderson`, `Scooby`

### Custom Wake Word Training

Want to create your own wake words? Thanks to the brilliant work by [dscripka/openWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord), you can train custom models using Google Colab.

#### Training Options

**Basic Training (Recommended for beginners):**
[üîó Google Colab - Basic Training](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q1oe2zOyZp7UsB3jJiQ1IFn8z5YfjwEb?usp=sharing)

**Advanced Training (For experienced users):**
[üîó Google Colab - Advanced Training](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyFH-fpguX2BTAW8wSQxTrJnJTM-0QAd?usp=sharing)

#### Model Conversion for Windows

After training your model in Colab (which outputs `.tflite` format), you need to convert it to ONNX for Windows compatibility:

```bash
# Install conversion tools
pip install tf2onnx tensorflow

# Convert TFLite to ONNX (one command)
python -m tf2onnx.convert --tflite your_model.tflite --output your_model.onnx
```

Once converted, place your `your_model.onnx` file in the `models/` directory and add the model name (without extension) to your wake word configuration.

**Pro tip:** Test your custom model thoroughly before relying on it. Custom models can be finicky as fuck and might not work as well as the pre-trained ones.

## üìö FAQ

**Q: Does it work on Linux/Mac?**  
A: Linux support added in v1.1.0 (beta). Use the install script. Mac support not planned.

**Q: Can I change the animation?**  
A: Yes, edit `frontend/index.html`. Shaders are in GLSL, so you need to know what you're doing.

**Q: Why Flet instead of Tkinter?**  
A: Tkinter had threading issues that caused hangs and crashes. Flet provides modern UI, proper async support, and cross-platform consistency. Plus it looks way better.

**Q: Can I use the old Tkinter settings?**  
A: Legacy support exists in `improved_settings_dialog.py` but it's not recommended. Flet version is more stable and feature-rich.

**Q: Why WebRTC VAD?**  
A: Because it works better than homemade algorithms. Tested by Google, so probably good.

**Q: Settings window is too big/small?**  
A: Flet UI is responsive and auto-maximizes. Use Escape key to close or resize the window.

**Q: App uses too much CPU/memory?**  
A: Disable animations in Settings > Advanced > Interface & Performance. This removes Three.js rendering and WebSocket server while keeping full voice functionality.

**Q: How do I set up interactive prompts?**  
A: Add the rest_command to your HA configuration.yaml, restart HA, then test with Developer Tools or curl. Interactive prompts are enabled by default in GLaSSIST v2.0.

**Q: Can external apps use the API?**  
A: Yes! Any application that can make HTTP POST requests can trigger GLaSSIST prompts. Perfect for integration with other home automation systems, scripts, or custom applications.

**Q: What's the difference between regular wake word and interactive prompts?**  
A: Regular wake word is user-initiated ("Hey Jarvis, turn on lights"). Interactive prompts are system-initiated (HA asks "Turn on lights?" and waits for voice response).
